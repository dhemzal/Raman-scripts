# Raman-srcipts

This repository contains some generic perl procedures that can be used to handle Raman data prior to their visualisation in several directions:
   
   - basic: accumulation, smoothing, luminescence treatment, dataset splitting
   - advanced: peak picking/fitting, derivative spectra
   - statistic: covariance analysis, spectra decompostion (PCA)
   
 THE REPOSITORY IS YET IN SET-UP PHASE

Motivation is to allow for codified treatment of the spectra by different users.

Intention is to keep things simple.

Actually, the only data structure constraint is a tab-separated two-column text file; three-column (time snapshots) and four column (mapping measurements) can be handled too via dataset splitting.
